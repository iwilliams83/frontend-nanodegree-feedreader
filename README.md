# Project Overview

The goal of this project was to write various test suites for an existing application.


## Why write test suites?

Testing is an important part of the development process, and "test-driven development" is a standard industry practice. It is common for developers to write tests first, before they start developing an application. In this process (known as "red, green, refactor"), all the tests initially fail, and then they start writing code to make the tests pass.


## Usage instructions

To explore this application, fork and clone the repo, and open the index.html file. Scroll down to the bottom of the page to see the test log.

The test suite, which uses the Jasmine framework, is located in the feedreader.js file.
